        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Knight MAPS</strong> is a conceptual campus navigation and planning application designed to help
          University of Central Florida students quickly locate buildings, view class schedules, and navigate campus
          efficiently. The project focused on creating an intuitive, low-friction user experience for everyday campus
          use and time-sensitive class transitions.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
          The application was prototyped in <strong>Figma</strong> and evaluated through a structured
          <strong>usability study</strong> involving six participants. Each participant completed fifteen core tasks
          using a think-aloud protocol, which helped uncover usability issues based on real user behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key features explored include interactive campus maps, building search, step-by-step navigation, and a
          crowdsourced tips system where students can share location-specific advice.
        </p>

      <section id="results">
        <h2>Results & Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>All participants successfully completed all tasks, indicating strong learnability and usability.</li>
          <li>Navigation-related tasks were generally completed quickly, suggesting clear structure and hierarchy.</li>
          <li>
            The primary usability challenges occurred in the crowdsourced tips feature, where users occasionally
            confused saved tips, personal posts, and inbox-style views.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These findings informed proposed improvements such as clearer labeling and grouping for the tips system,
          more consistent iconography, and better visibility for step-by-step navigation entry points.
