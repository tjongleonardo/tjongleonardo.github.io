        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Nile.com (NileDotCom)</strong> is a desktop GUI application built in Java that simulates a simple
          online ordering workflow. Users can search for items, enter quantities, review item details and subtotals,
          add multiple items to a cart, and finalize an order. The project emphasizes building a working GUI using
          <strong>Eclipse WindowBuilder</strong> while connecting UI actions to backend logic like calculations and file output.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Item lookup/search workflow tied to a button click (event-driven UI)</li>
          <li>Quantity input, item detail display, and subtotal calculation</li>
          <li>Multi-item cart display within the GUI</li>
          <li>Order confirmation and completion steps</li>
          <li>Transaction logging to a transactions.csv output file</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
        <p>
          The interface was designed visually using WindowBuilder, then wired to Java event handlers
          (e.g., ActionListener) so each button triggers the appropriate logic. The project required careful
          state management for cart progress (current item count, running total, etc.) and consistent updates to GUI fields
          as the user moved through the order steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          The completed order is recorded by writing transaction lines to a CSV file, reinforcing practical file I/O
          and output formatting.
